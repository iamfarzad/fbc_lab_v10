# Cursor AI Rules for fbc_lab_v10 Project

## CRITICAL: Context Preservation Rules

### 1. ALWAYS Read Status File First
**Before doing ANYTHING, read:**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project status
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `docs/IMPORT_ORDER.md` - Current import progress

### 2. ALWAYS Update Status After Changes
**After ANY significant change:**
- Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with:
  - What was done
  - Current phase
  - Next steps
  - Any blockers

### 3. NEVER Skip Status Updates
**Status must be updated when:**
- Importing files
- Fixing issues
- Completing phases
- Encountering blockers
- Making decisions

### 4. Context Preservation Checklist
**At start of each session:**
- [ ] Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- [ ] Read `docs/README.md`
- [ ] Check last modified files
- [ ] Review current phase in `IMPORT_ORDER.md`
- [ ] Check for blockers/issues

**At end of each session:**
